# hal
Easily create and manage Kubernetes applications using Dekorate and the Halkyon operator, made with ❤️ by the Snowdrop team.

- `git clone` this project *outside* of your `$GOPATH` (since it uses `go modules`) or set `GO111MODULE=on` on your environment
- Build: `cd hal;make` with Go 1.11+ (currently only 1.12 is tested)
- Run: `./hal`, this will display the inline help
- Enjoy!
